# sql-challenge
This challenge took multiple csv files about employees, their departments, salaries etc. I took all the data and made several tables picking out the desired informtion in special groups. Such as: 
- employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee 
- first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986 
- the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name
-  the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name 
-  first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B 
- each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name 
- each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
- the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)
